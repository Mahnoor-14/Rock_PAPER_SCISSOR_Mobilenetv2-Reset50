# Rock_PAPER_SCISSOR_Mobilenetv2-Reset50
This project compares two popular pretrained CNN architectures—MobileNetV2 and ResNet50—using transfer learning on the Rock-Paper-Scissors image classification dataset. The goal is to evaluate trade-offs in accuracy, training speed, model size, and inference efficiency when applying these models to a small-scale classification task.
